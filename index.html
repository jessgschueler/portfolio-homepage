      <img src="img/me.png" alt="A photo of jess sitting on a rock formation at The Giant's Causeway">
      <p>I was born in a small, but beautiful hidden gem of a town in Northwest Washington. <em>(I'll never tell!)</em> I liked it so much it took me 26 years to leave. Since arriving in Portland, if I'm not at my desk you can most likely find me at the bouldering gym, Powell Butte, or wandering the streets of Portland in search of Boba Tea.</p>
