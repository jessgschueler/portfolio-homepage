        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <img src="img/me.png" alt="A photo of jess sitting on a rock formation at The Giant's Causeway">
        <p>I was born in a small but beautiful hidden gem of a town in Northwest Washington. I liked it so much it took me 26 years to leave. Since arriving in Portland, if I'm not at my desk you can most likely find me at the climbing gym, Powell Butte (my favorite place for a picnic!), or wandering the streets of Portland in search of Boba Tea.</p>

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>I come to programming from a non-traditional background. I have a Bachelor of Arts from Western Washington University in political science. After college I worked in e-commerce for a few years before I took some time off to travel. When I returned from travelling in early 2020, like many of us, I stayed inside. <br> <br>
        Covid-19 lockdown <em>really</em> made me reevaluate my career path so far. Between attempts to bake sourdough and zoom game nights, I started to teach myself python. When I moved to Portland, I decided to get more serious about my love of programming and that led me to the Epicodus March 2022 cohort.
